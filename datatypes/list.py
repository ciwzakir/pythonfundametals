"""
The Python List is an ordered collection (also known as a sequence ) of elements. List elements can be accessed, iterated, and removed according to the order they inserted at the creation time.
We use the list data type to represent groups of the element as a single entity.  For example: If we want to store all student’s names, we can use list type.
The list can contain data of all data types such as  int, float, string
Duplicates elements are allowed in the list
The list is mutable which means we can modify the value of list elements

We can create a list using the two ways

By enclosing elements in the square brackets [].
Using a list() class.
